Here's an expanded description of a To-Do List Application, including key features:

**To-Do List Application**

**Description:** The To-Do List Application is a simple yet practical project that helps users organize their tasks and manage their daily activities efficiently. It can be implemented as a console-based application, making it accessible to users directly from the command line.

**Key Features:**

1. **Task Management:**
   - Users can add tasks to the to-do list, specifying a task name, description, and due date (if desired).
   - Tasks can be marked as completed or not completed, allowing users to track their progress.

2. **Task List Display:**
   - The application displays a list of tasks, including task names, descriptions, due dates, and completion status.
   - Users can view their entire to-do list or filter tasks based on criteria such as completion status or due date.

3. **Task Editing and Deletion:**
   - Users can edit task details, including the task name, description, due date, and completion status.
   - Tasks can be deleted if they are no longer relevant or needed.

4. **Task Prioritization:**
   - Implement a system for setting task priorities (e.g., high, medium, low) or deadlines to help users focus on the most important tasks.

5. **Task Sorting:**
   - Allow users to sort their task list based on different criteria, such as due date or priority.

6. **Data Persistence:**
   - Store the to-do list data persistently, so users can access their tasks even after closing and reopening the application. You can use a file-based approach (e.g., storing data in a text or CSV file) for simplicity.

7. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - Design a clean and easy-to-navigate command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction. Use menus or command prompts to guide users through task management.

8. **User Authentication (Optional):**
   - Implement a basic user authentication system if you want to add multiple user support. Users can create accounts and have their own separate to-do lists.

9. **Search and Filter:**
   - Allow users to search for specific tasks by keywords or filter tasks based on various criteria, such as task name, due date, or priority.

10. **Reminders (Optional):**
    - Implement a feature to send reminders or notifications to users for tasks with upcoming due dates.

11. **Data Backup (Optional):**
    - Provide an option for users to back up their task data to prevent data loss.

12. **Export and Import (Optional):**
    - Allow users to export their task list to a file and import it back into the application, making it easy to transfer data between instances.

This To-Do List Application is a versatile project that can be customized and expanded based on your programming skills and the needs of your users. It provides hands-on experience with data storage, user interaction, and creating a functional command-line application.
